# Jarvis
A virtual assistant which has functions like face recognition, news headlines, opening facebook and e-mailing.

I have uploaded different files of each functionalities.

Everyone might have heard about the Tony Stark's device JARVIS, yes i have coded some similar functionalites.
Face recognition will let you recgonise the face of the person and is saved in the device.
I have used a API for headlines of news which display news with the default sound while printing the news.
Open facebook is a basic idea to open browser, it can be opened by typing "open facebook".
Emailing is possible by enabling the smtp/pop protocols of the sender/receiver email address.
